@defmodule[lsl #:lang]

The Logical Student Language (LSL)
is a teaching language that extends the
Intermediate Student Language (ISL)
from @emph{How to Design Programs}
with features that support formally reasoning about programs.
In particular,
LSL tightly integrates contracts
and property-based randomized testing.

@defform[(define-struct structure-name (field-name ...))]{

  Defines a new structure called @racket[structure-name]. The structure's fields are
  named by the @racket[field-name]s. After the @racket[define-struct], the following new
  functions are available:

  @itemize[

    @item{@racketidfont{make-}@racket[structure-name] : takes a number of
          arguments equal to the number of fields in the structure,
          and creates a new instance of that structure.}

    @item{@racket[structure-name]@racketidfont{-}@racket[field-name] : takes an
          instance of the structure and returns the value in the field named by
          @racket[field-name].}
    @item{@racketidfont{set-}@racket[structure-name]@racketidfont{-}@racket[field-name]@racketidfont{!} : takes an
          instance of the structure and a value, and sets the field named by
          @racket[field-name] in the given instance of the structure to the given value.}

    @item{@racket[structure-name]@racketidfont{?} : takes any value, and returns
          @racket[#t] if the value is an instance of the structure.}
  ]

  The name of the new functions introduced by @racket[define-struct]
  must not be the same as that of other functions or variables,
  otherwise @racket[define-struct] reports an error.

  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:no-prompt #:label #f
    (define-struct posn [x y])
    (define a-posn (make-posn 0 0))
    (posn-x a-posn)]
  }

@defform[(define-mutable-struct structure-name (field-name ...))]{
  Like @racket[define-struct], except functions that mutate the struct are available:
  @racketidfont{set-}@racket[structure-name]@racketidfont{-}@racket[field-name]@racketidfont{!} takes an
  instance of the structure and a value, and sets the field named by
  @racket[field-name] in the given instance of the structure to the given value.

  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:no-prompt #:label #f
    (define-mutable-struct box [value])
    (define a-box (make-box 0))
    (set-box-value! a-box 1)
    (box-value a-box)]
}

@defform[(begin expr0 ... expr)]{
  Executes the given expressions in sequence, returning the last @racket[expr].
}

@defform[(set! id expr)]{
  Mutates the variable @racket[id] with the value of @racket[expr].
}

@defform[(raise (make-struct-name ...))]{
  Raises an exception, where @racket[make-struct-name] constructs a struct
  that can have multiple arguments.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
  (define-struct foo ())
  (eval:error (raise (make-foo)))]
}

@defform*[[(check-raises expression)
          (check-raises expression structure-name)]]{
  Checks that the @racket[expression] raises an exception via @racket[raise], where
  the name of the struct raised in the exception matches @racket[structure-name], if it is present.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
  (define-struct foo ())
  (define (always-raise) (raise (make-foo)))
  (check-raises (always-raise))
  (check-raises (always-raise) foo)
  (define-struct bar ())
  (check-raises (always-raise) bar)]
}

@defproc[(remove-duplicates [l list?]) list?]{
  Removes duplicates from a list without altering its order using @racket[equal?] for equality.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
  (remove-duplicates '(0 1 1 2))]
}

@section{Testing}

@defform[(test-suite "name" ...)]{
Declares a named block of tests. Aside from printing and for autograding, no different from
putting @racket[check-expect] or similar at the top-level.
}

@section{Contracts}

@defform[(define-contract id contract)]{
  Creates @racket[id] as an alias for @racket[contract].

  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:no-prompt #:label #f
    (define-contract IntToInt
      (-> Integer Integer))]
}

@defform[(: id contract)]{
  Annotates @racket[id] with a contract.
  When @racket[id] is created with @racket[define],
  the contract is attached to the defined value.

  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:no-prompt #:label #f
    (: on-two-and-three (-> (-> Integer Integer) Integer))
    (define (on-two-and-three g)
      (+ (g 2) (g 3)))]

  Uses of @racket[on-two-and-three] are protected:

  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (on-two-and-three (lambda (x) (* x x)))
    (eval:error (on-two-and-three (lambda (x) (/ x 2))))]
}

@subsection{Primitives}

@defform[(Immediate clause ...)]{
  An @emph{immediate contract} is one that can be checked immediately,
  without imposing any future checks.
  As a shorthand,
  an ordinary LSL expression @racket[e]
  in a contract position
  is automatically converted to the immediate contract
  @racket[(Immediate (check e))].
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:no-prompt #:label #f
    (define-contract Even
      (Immediate (check (lambda (x) (and (integer? x) (even? x))))
                 (generate (lambda (fuel) (* 2 (contract-generate Integer fuel))))
                 (feature "positive?" positive?)
                 (shrink (lambda (fuel x)
                           (let ([y (/ x 2)])
                             (if (even? y) y (sub1 y)))))))]

  @defsubform[(check predicate-expr)]{
    The @racket[predicate-expr] is expected to produce a predicate
    that determines if a value satisfies the contract.
  }

  @defsubform[(generate gen-expr)]{
    The @racket[gen-expr] should evaluate to a function
    that takes a single natural number,
    the @emph{fuel},
    and produces a value that satisfies the contract.
    Fuel provides a rough measure of how
    hard the generator is willing to work
    to produce a value.
  }

  @defsubform[(feature name-string feature-expr)]{
    The @racket[feature-expr] function takes one argument,
    a value satisfying the contract. It then computes some
    property of that value for use in Tyche.
    An @racket[Immediate] can have more than one @racket[feature].
  }

  @defsubform[(shrink shrink-expr)]{
    The @racket[shrink-expr] function takes two arguments,
    fuel and a value to shrink. The value to shrink is
    guaranteed to satisfy the contract.
  }
}

@defform[(Function clause ...)]{
  A function contract protects a function by constraining its
  inputs and outputs. Arguments are labeled so that dependent
  properties can be checked.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:no-prompt #:label #f
    (: double (Function (arguments [x Integer])
                        (result (lambda (y) (= x y)))))
    (define (double x)
      (* 2 x))]

  The @racket[double] function violates this contract:
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (double 0)
    (eval:error (double 1))]

  @defsubform[(arguments [id contract] ...)]{
    Describes the contracts on arguments.
    Any @racket[id] can be used in any @racket[contract]
    and will be bound to the concrete argument when the
    function is applied,
    so long as there is no cyclic dependency.
  }

  @defsubform[(result contract)]{
    Describes the result contract.
    All @racket[id] values are available in @racket[contract].
  }

  @defsubform[(raises exn-id)]{
    Permits the @racket[exn-id] struct to be raised in the function.
    Such exceptions are not considered failures
    during property-based testing.
  }
}

@defform[(List contract)]{
  Describes a list of arbitrary length
  whose elements satisfy @racket[contract].
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (contract-generate (List Integer))]
}

@defform[(Tuple contract ...)]{
  Describes lists where the k-th element
  satisfies the k-th @racket[contract].
  The list must have exactly the same number of elements
  as there are contracts.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (contract-generate (Tuple Boolean Integer))]
}

@defform[(OneOf contract ...)]{
  A value satisfying a @racket[OneOf] contract
  must satisfy @emph{exactly one} of the
  given @racket[contract]s.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (contract-generate (List (OneOf Boolean Integer)))]
}

@defform[(AllOf contract ...)]{
  A value satisfying an @racket[AllOf] contract
  must satisfy @emph{all} of the
  given @racket[contract]s.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (define-contract UnitInterval
      (AllOf Real
             (lambda (x) (< 0 x))
	     (lambda (x) (< x 1))))
    (: reciprocal (-> UnitInterval Real))
    (define (reciprocal x) (/ 1 x))
    (reciprocal 1/2)
    (eval:error (reciprocal -2))
    (eval:error (reciprocal 2))]
}

@defform[(Struct struct-id (field-contract ...))]{
  Struct contracts describe each individual field on the struct.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (define-struct my-point (x y))
    (contract-generate (Struct my-point [Integer Integer]))]
}

@defform[(All (id ...) contract)]{
  A universal contract that guarantees @racket[id]
  is used uniformally within @racket[contract].
  This form is often used to define
  parametrically polymorphic functions.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (: id (All (A) (-> A A)))
    (define (id x) x)
    (id 10)]
}

@defform[(Exists (id ...) contract)]{
  An existential contract that guarantees @racket[id]
  is used uniformally within @racket[contract].
  This form is often used for data abstraction.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (: counter-pkg (Exists (A) (Tuple (-> A) (-> A A) (-> A Integer))))
    (define counter-pkg
      (list (λ () 0)
            (λ (x) (+ x 1))
            (λ (x) x)))
    (define make-counter (first counter-pkg))
    (define counter-incr (second counter-pkg))
    (define counter-get (third counter-pkg))
    (counter-get (counter-incr (make-counter)))]

@defform[(Maybe contract)]{
  Either @racket[#f] or a value satisfying the specified contract.

  To use a @racket[Maybe] value, you must check if the output is a Boolean with
  @racket[false?], or by using the contract for the associated type.

  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f

  @margin-note{
    The name of this contract rhymes with @emph{sword}
    since the contract @emph{records} values in a trace.
  }
  Uses the folding function @racket[folding-expr]
  to integrate values that pass through the contract
  into the value at @racket[trace-id].
  The folding function takes two arguments:
  the current value of @racket[trace-id]
  and the contracted value.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f
    (: down-prev (Maybe Natural))
    (define down-prev #f)

    (: down-folder (-> (Maybe Natural) Natural Natural))
    (define (down-folder prev cur)

@section{Property-Based Randomized Testing}

@defform*[[(check-contract id)
           (check-contract id attempts)
           (check-contract id attempts size-expr)]]{
  Attempts to break the contract placed on @racket[id]
  by randomly generating inputs.
  The number of times it attempts to do so is
  controlled by @racket[attempts].
  The @racket[size-expr] controls the fuel given to
  generators. If @racket[size-expr] is a number,
  that is used as the fuel. If it is a procedure,
  then it accepts the iteration number and
  returns the fuel.
  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f

  @examples[#:eval evaluator #:label #f

}

@defform[(with-traces body ...)]{
  After executing the @racket[body] expressions,
  @racket[with-traces] restores the value of traces
  to their values before the @racket[body] expressions ran.
  This is useful when you have a set of tests that use @racket[Record] on the same trace.

  To use this, @racket[(require lsl/performance)].

  Outputs a visualization graphing how much time

}

@section{Concurrency}

@margin-note{
  Concurrency is not the same as parallelism.
  In parallelism,
  computations occur simultaneously,
  not just in an arbitrary order.
}
A concurrent system is one in which the order of computations occur may vary.
There are many models of concurrency, but the one supported by LSL is
based on the @emph{actor model}.

An actor system consists of a number of actors (or processes) that are
identified by a unique name. Actors send immutable values (or messages) to one
another. These messages are then processed by the receiving actor. Messages are
guaranteed to be delivered in FIFO (first-in-first-out) between two actors.
However, the order in which messages are delivered among all actors is
unspecified. When starting an actor system, a scheduler can be provided to fix
some delivery policy.

See @racket[start] for an example of a concurrent system.

 Extracts the message (data) from a received packet.

@defform[(Action contract)]{
  Describes an action containing a new state
  that satisfies @racket[contract] and a list of packets to send satisfying
  @racket[(List (SendPacket Any))].

}

@defproc[(action [state Any] [packets (List (SendPacket Any))]) (Action Any)]{
  The result of a process handler: combines the updated process state and a list of packets to
  send (which may be empty).
  The list of packets is sorted (per process) from earliest to latest.
  In the example above,
  @racket[process-1] is guaranteed to receive the @racket[42] packet
  before it receives the @racket[43] packet.
  However, the relative order the packets are received
  among different processes is unknown @emph{a priori}
  (as it is determined by the scheduler).

A contract for a process.

  Runs a concurrent program using a fixed list of processes.
  When no more messages need to be processed, the function returns a list of pairs
  of the process name and final state.

  The example below demonstrates a concurrent program with two processes, @code{a} and @code{b},
  which send greetings back and forth. The program starts with @code{a} greeting @code{b}.
  Each process has its own @emph{state}, remembering how many greetings it has sent so far.
  Once each process has sent three greetings, they stop greeting, and the concurrent program
  terminates.

  Like @racket[start], but runs the program in an interactive graphical interface instead.
  The interface allows you to step forward and backward through the program, viewed through
  either a graph showing the current packet being sent/received, a table of the current messages
  waiting to be processed, or a history of all process states up to the current moment.

  The extra argument, @racket[summarize-state], is a function that is applied to the process
  state before it is displayed, since large process states can make the interface harder to use.
  The @racket[identity] function can be provided if you want the entire process state visible.
